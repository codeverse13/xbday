      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <div class="story-container">
        <p class="story-text">
          It all began on a soft February 23rd. That day, neither of us said it
          out loud but deep inside we had already tucked a little piece of each
          other into our hearts. We weren’t lovers yet but we were something —
          something gentle and growing.
          <span class="highlight">We started as friends</span>, the kind that
          find comfort in every conversation, in every shared meme, every "are
          you okay?" and "don’t forget to eat."
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          Days passed and friendship bloomed into best-friendship.
          <span class="highlight">We became each other’s diary</span>, secret
          keeper, and silent cheerleader. We knew each other’s chaos, the curves
          of every mood, every scar, every beautiful flaw. In vacations when the
          world slowed down our bond grew faster. We were just two souls
          discovering that no matter the distance or silence we’d always return
          to each other.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          <span class="highlight">It was in the stolen moments</span>  brushing
          shoulders, resting heads, that warm silence while watching something
          together  where love took root. From quick handholds under the table
          to long deep stares we never spoke of, we were falling. And when the
          fall became too loud to hide, we still whispered it.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          There were late night confessions, sweet jealousy, us figuring out how
          to navigate a world that wasn’t ready for us just yet.
          <span class="highlight">We kept our love hidden</span>, tucked behind
          friend labels and quiet glances. But inside we were already "us." We
          were already dreaming together.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          Slowly we unfolded in public. What was once a secret bloomed under the
          sun. We had our first little date  shy smiles, nervous laughter, yet
          everything felt so right. From hiding behind walls to holding hands
          proudly, from teasing nicknames to forehead kisses, we grew. We
          weren’t rushing. We were blooming.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          <span class="highlight">Every moment became a memory</span>. The way
          your fingers found mine like they belonged there. The sound of your
          sleepy "goodnight" like a lullaby only I got to hear. The comfort of
          your presence when my mind was too loud. From fights to makeups, from
          misunderstandings to midnight hugs, we built something real — a love
          that doesn’t flinch.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          Then came December.
          <span class="highlight">On the 3rd of December</span>, we finally said
          what was always written between our lines. We finally got together. It
          wasn’t sudden it was inevitable. That moment sealed the truth we
          always carried  that we were meant to be. That day, everything
          aligned and our love became real in every possible way.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          Now here we are. From friends to best friends, from almosts to always.
          We’ve made it through storms, through silence, through days when words
          failed but love didn’t.
          <span class="highlight">We know each other’s curves</span>  the mood
          swings, the chaos, the tenderness, and the kind of love that walks in
          even when you push it away. We know us. And we choose us, again and
          again.
        </p>

        <p class="story-text">
          <span class="highlight">Ours is not just a love story</span>. It’s a
          universe. A collage of warmth, truth, softness, and fire. And the best
          part? We’re just getting started. And this little gift  this whole
          page  is here to remind us of all of that. Because today is
          <span class="highlight">2nd July</span>, your birthday, and if this
          makes you even smile a little, then its purpose is already fulfilled.
