    <h2>21 Wishes for the Love of My Life</h2>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish for you to wake up every morning knowing you are deeply loved</p>
      <p>to look in the mirror and see the magic I see in you</p>
      <p>to walk through your days with grace in your steps and courage in your chest</p>
      <p>to always feel me right beside you, in silence or storm</p>
      <p>to never doubt your worth, even when the world feels too heavy</p>
      <p>and to know you are my forever kind of person</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you never stop smiling like you do when you’re sleepy and soft</p>
      <p>because that smile holds galaxies I could get lost in</p>
      <p>I wish the world slows down when you're overwhelmed</p>
      <p>so you can breathe and remember how strong you are</p>
      <p>and I hope you always come back to my arms when it all feels too much</p>
      <p>because I’ll always be your safest place</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish the universe gifts you peace every time your heart aches</p>
      <p>and fills your chest with warmth when the night feels too long</p>
      <p>I hope you always have music that feels like your heartbeat</p>
      <p>and people who see you like I do  the whole constellation</p>
      <p>I wish you find beauty in the quiet things</p>
      <p>and in moments you didn’t even know were special until later</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you never forget the way I look at you</p>
      <p>like you're the only miracle that ever mattered</p>
      <p>like the world built itself just to hold your softness</p>
      <p>I wish every sunset reminds you of our little forever</p>
      <p>and every breeze feels like a whisper from me</p>
      <p>saying you are loved beyond every language</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish the future never scares you too much</p>
      <p>because you carry light in your hands and bravery in your spine</p>
      <p>I hope you chase your dreams like they’ve been waiting for you</p>
      <p>and find me clapping at every single milestone</p>
      <p>I wish you always believe in the fire you hold</p>
      <p>and know I believe in you endlessly</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you never run out of words to say to yourself</p>
      <p>especially the kind that remind you how lovely you are</p>
      <p>how human and healing and worthy</p>
      <p>how every scar on you still sings</p>
      <p>I hope you speak gently to your own soul</p>
      <p>and never forget your voice can move mountains</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your laughter never fades into silence</p>
      <p>and your joy never feels too loud for this world</p>
      <p>I hope you dance like you used to when you were little</p>
      <p>unafraid of how much space you take up</p>
      <p>I hope I can always be the one clapping offbeat</p>
      <p>just happy you’re smiling</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you keep falling in love with life again and again</p>
      <p>with the tiny details that most people miss</p>
      <p>the sound of birds, the light through your lashes</p>
      <p>your name in my mouth on a quiet morning</p>
      <p>you are poetry in motion, baby</p>
      <p>and I’ll keep rereading you forever</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish the world is kind to your softness</p>
      <p>that it doesn’t take advantage of your heart</p>
      <p>that the people around you protect you like I do</p>
      <p>with love like armor and gentleness like fire</p>
      <p>you deserve safety in every form</p>
      <p>and I will always be part of that</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you always feel beautiful in your own skin</p>
      <p>even on days when the mirror lies</p>
      <p>I hope you see what I see in you</p>
      <p>a soul that radiates gold and grace</p>
      <p>I wish you feel loved by your reflection</p>
      <p>and adored by the universe itself</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your mind feels safe inside itself</p>
      <p>with no storms louder than your peace</p>
      <p>I hope your thoughts feel like warm hands</p>
      <p>and your overthinking rests in my love</p>
      <p>I wish I could live in your mind some days</p>
      <p>just to leave little love notes behind</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your hands never feel empty</p>
      <p>that they’re always filled with purpose or mine</p>
      <p>I hope they get to create beautiful things</p>
      <p>painted joy, written love, soft gestures</p>
      <p>I wish to hold them in my sleep and my waking</p>
      <p>until forever forgets how to count</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish every tear you ever cry brings healing</p>
      <p>not shame or silence</p>
      <p>but space to feel and space to grow</p>
      <p>and I hope I’m always the one who wipes them</p>
      <p>who says nothing but stays anyway</p>
      <p>loving you through the ache</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish for you a life filled with tiny joys</p>
      <p>like the perfect bite of cake or your favorite song in traffic</p>
      <p>like finding someone has already warmed your spot in bed</p>
      <p>or someone remembering how you take your tea</p>
      <p>I want to be that someone</p>
      <p>in every lifetime we’re given</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your name feels like a blessing to your own ears</p>
      <p>not something to hide or apologize for</p>
      <p>but something that blooms when whispered</p>
      <p>I will always say your name like a prayer</p>
      <p>like a song that saved me</p>
      <p>because it did</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your past never haunts you</p>
      <p>but reminds you how much you've grown</p>
      <p>I hope the shadows stay behind you</p>
      <p>and the future stays soft</p>
      <p>I’ll walk beside you through both</p>
      <p>hand in hand, always</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your laugh never forgets its way out</p>
      <p>even when you feel too tired to smile</p>
      <p>I want to be the reason it escapes again</p>
      <p>even just once on a hard day</p>
      <p>your laughter is my favorite music</p>
      <p>and I never want it to fade</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish love always feels like this for you</p>
      <p>safe and warm and a little wild</p>
      <p>unfolding in everyday moments</p>
      <p>not just fireworks but the candle that stays lit</p>
      <p>and if this is the love you asked for</p>
      <p>I hope I get to keep giving it to you</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish your dreams come true</p>
      <p>the quiet ones and the loud ones</p>
      <p>the ones you speak and the ones you hide</p>
      <p>I wish you always feel deserving of joy</p>
      <p>and that joy always leads you back to me</p>
      <p>because you’re the heart of mine</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you always remember this day</p>
      <p>as a celebration of you and everything you are</p>
      <p>a girl who loves deeply and fights silently</p>
      <p>who carries both fire and softness like art</p>
      <p>I wish to celebrate you every day</p>
      <p>because loving you feels like a lifetime gift</p>
    </div>

    <div class="wish">
      <p>I wish you know this — you are my heart</p>
      <p>you are the softness in my hard days</p>
      <p>the home I never thought I’d find</p>
      <p>you are the reason behind every smile I wear</p>
      <p>and today isn’t just your birthday</p>
      <p>it’s the day the world gave me my miracle</p>
    </div>
